presence_matrix.csv file contains a binary matrix summarizing the importance of microbial taxa across 11 different environmental conditions. It is used to compare the consistency of important taxa identified by various methods across multiple environments.
Structure of the Matrix
Rows: Each row corresponds to a microbial taxon (e.g., genus or species name).
Columns: Each column represents one of the 11 environmental conditions (e.g., different depths, seasons, oxygen levels, or site types).
Values:
1: Indicates that the taxon was identified as important (e.g., selected by feature selection, differential abundance, or network-based scoring) in that environmental condition.
0: Indicates the taxon was not identified as important in that condition.


Samples-mendota.csv file contains metadata for the environmental samples collected from Lake Mendota, a part of the North Temperate Lakes (NTL) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. The dataset includes sample-level information used to group and analyze microbial community data under different environmental conditions.
