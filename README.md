# Unraveling Keystone Taxa: Interactions Within Microbial Networks and Environmental Dynamics in Lake Mendota
## Folder Structure
The detailed instruction of setting up and running the codes are provided in the README files of each of the following folder.
| Folder | Description|
|---|---|
|`data`| This directory contains all the raw data used in the project. It's crucial not to modify these files directly to ensure the reproducibility of the analysis.|
|`code`| All scripts and other code files for the project are stored here. These files include data cleaning, analysis, and visualization scripts.|
|`output`| This directory contains the output figures generated by two specific scripts in the `code` directory: `Car-figures.R` and `lake-microbiome-figures.py`. It holds visual representations such as figures, which summarize the findings and results of the analyses conducted by these scripts.|

## Issues and questions
Issues and questions are encouraged through the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/solislemuslab/lake-microbiome-data-analysis/issues). For bugs or errors, please make sure to provide enough details for us to reproduce the error on our end.
