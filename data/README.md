### `data`
This directory stores the raw data files used in the project analyses. The following files are included:

- **`MAG_taxonomy.tsv`**: This file contains taxonomic information for metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). It includes classifications at various taxonomic levels, providing a foundational dataset for understanding microbial identities.

- **`coverm_431_MAGS_metagenomes_reads_count.csv`**: This CSV file features read count data from metagenomic sequencing of 431 MAGs. It's used to quantify the abundance of each genome in different environmental samples.

- **`coverm_431_MAGS_metatransciptome_count.tsv`**: This TSV file presents transcriptome count data for the same 431 MAGs, reflecting their gene expression levels under various conditions. This dataset is crucial for analyzing the functional activity of the microbial communities.

These files are essential for the project's data analysis processes and should not be altered to maintain the integrity and reproducibility of the results.
